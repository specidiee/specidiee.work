In algebra, the **quadratic formula** is used to solve quadratic equations of the form:

$$
ax^2 + bx + c = 0
$$

The solution is given by:

$$
x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
$$

## Implementation in Python

```python
import cmath

def solve_quadratic(a, b, c):
    d = (b**2) - (4*a*c)
    sol1 = (-b - cmath.sqrt(d)) / (2*a)
    sol2 = (-b + cmath.sqrt(d)) / (2*a)
    return sol1, sol2
```
